### Planning rule

Use this rule when asked to **create a development plan** or **write planning docs**.

The goal is to avoid “big bang” implementations by producing plans that are:

- **Incremental** (one slice per PR)
- **UI-verifiable** after every slice
- **Unambiguous** (clear contract, clear checkpoints)

---

### 1) Required document structure (in each plan folder)

Every plan folder must contain:

- **`README.md`** (the entry point)
- **Numbered docs**:
  - `01-ux-and-behavior.md`
  - `02-implementation-notes.md` (engineering notes, pitfalls, file touchpoints)
  - `03-incremental-implementation-slices.md` (execution order; source of truth)
- **`TASKS.md`** (assignable backlog; **maps 1:1 to slices**)

Optional (only if needed):

- `future-limits-backlog.md` or similar “parking lot” doc for undecided follow-ups.

---

### 2) `README.md` requirements (must include)

`README.md` must include, in this order:

- **What we’re shipping** (1–3 bullets, user-visible)
- **Repo status / what exists today** (grounded in current codebase)
- **Locked product decisions** (explicit constraints)
- **How to follow these docs** (“clear path”)
  - read UX first
  - use slices as the source of truth
  - one slice per PR
  - don’t proceed until checkpoint passes
- **Document map** (links to each doc)

---

### 3) Slice format (in `03-incremental-implementation-slices.md`)

Every slice must follow this template:

- **Deliverable**: what changes from the user’s perspective (or visible internal milestone)
- **Touchpoints**: the expected files/services (keep to ~2–6 focused files)
- **Manual checkpoint**: step-by-step instructions to validate
- **Rollback**: how to disable/revert (usually via feature flag)
- **Notes**: optional (edge cases, “gotchas”)

Non-negotiables:

- One slice per PR
- Every slice UI-verifiable
- No unrelated refactors

---

### 5) `TASKS.md` rules

- Each task maps **1:1** to a slice
- Tasks are ordered; don’t skip ahead
- Use status markers:
  - **[TODO]**, **[WIP]**, **[DONE]**
